# About Us

We are part of the international community of Triratna Buddhist groups and centres. 

Triratna is an international Buddhist movement which draws from all the more traditional branches of Buddhism to provide tools that are contemporary and relevant for those seeking more peace or meaning and purpose in their lives. 

We are a small, friendly group based in Deal and meet to explore together the timeless Buddhist practises of meditation, mindfulness and emotional positivity. 

We welcome both newcomers and those with some experience of meditation and Buddhism.
