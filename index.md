# Software Design and Engineering:

The artifact selected for the software design and engineering category is the pymongo CRUD aplication from Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  The aplciations goal is to create the functionitily of CRUD for use with the mongodb database.  This showcaseese software design and engineering skills by examding the Python PyMongo drivers with dash framework intigartion.  With the CRUD module exanded with a Query and List funtion, this allows the data to be manipulated in a more streamlined way.

# Algorithm and Data Structures:

The artifact selectedd for the Alogorithim and data structure category is the Pymongo Script created and used in the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  I selected this artifact becacuse its consists of design considerations and creating an API to both use the artifact from software design and enineering and theailbity to quickly call an APU and manipulate and test data.  This showcases data structure skills with creating a script to quickly excute the expanded CRUD funtionity with the previous catoeries Query and List functions.

# Database:

For the database category I decided to use the data from the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  I wanted to create a web application within the github enviroment that allowed uses to view and see the data.  This showcases skills in the database skill set, by manpulated the data and showing it in a grah based form.
