# Welcome

This ePortfolio integrates the knowledge and skills I gained and developed throughout the years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It represent my growth in the program and gained honor rolls from high-quality outcomes. The ePortfolio was designed and developed with a professional-quality written and a visual communication demonstrative of my capacities and abilities in a coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to an specific technical audience and context.

# Professional self-assessment

I began my computer science journey starting in April 2019.  I decided on the computer science program because of my passion for working with and technology and software.  While in this program I gained knowledge and skills in many different applications.  I have improved my organization skills, attention to detail and understanding how workflow works when dealing with software development.  With going through this program, I have learned how to implement code reviews, best practices and security standards to all my code.  I also, learned the importance of Software Development Lifecycle and how this is implemented to enterprise scale operations.  By incorporating the SDLC into my coding practices I can correctly use pseudocode, Flow charts and algorithms.

Throughout the program has led to an increased capacity for learning with being able to bring solutions to problems when data, software and technology are involved.  While completing this program I have gained many skills and then throughout the courses my capacity for those sills increased as well.  Learning and implementing how agile and waterfall developments works into my projects as well as using fundamentally computer science foundations to build them.

Skills I learned over the course in relation to the development pipe line was planning and finding what the needs of the project are.  In the screen shot below is the beginning on the planning phase for a database for a pizza company.  These planning phase makes sure all needs are covered and implemented into the planning phase.  This allows a check list to go over as each class is built in to the desired database.  With experience using MongoDB, SQL, and NoSQL these skilsl coudl be used and applied into any envrioment.

## Preparing for the Future

The SNHU computer science program was instrumental for helping me grow not only as a programmer but also as a professional.  The course helped prepare me for a future in any of the software engineering career fields.  With basic skills built into software engineering, data analytics and full stack engineering.  This ePortfolio shows that I have all those necessary skills as a foundation and the skills to integrate them together for success.  I really am looking forward to being my career in one of those fields to expand my skills and grow as a professional.

# Refinement Plan and Code Review

On my career path as a software engineer I have learned code reviews and refinement plans are a integral part of the career and a big part of being successful in it.  Code reviews can range from personal reviews of your own code or peer reviews of others code or having those peers review yours.  Anytime you can have more eyes and reviews of code its beneficial not only in growing as a professional but making sure security flaws or errors are found early in the process.  Anytime you build and have a collaborative environment as a person or company, everyone will benefit from you, the company and the clients.

# Software Design and Engineering

The artifact selected for the software design and engineering category is the pymongo CRUD aplication from Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  The aplciations goal is to create the functionitily of CRUD for use with the mongodb database.  This showcaseese software design and engineering skills by examding the Python PyMongo drivers with dash framework intigartion.  With the CRUD module exanded with a Query and List funtion, this allows the data to be manipulated in a more streamlined way.

# Algorithms and Data Structure

The artifact selectedd for the Alogorithim and data structure category is the Pymongo Script created and used in the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  I selected this artifact becacuse its consists of design considerations and creating an API to both use the artifact from software design and enineering and theailbity to quickly call an APU and manipulate and test data.  This showcases data structure skills with creating a script to quickly excute the expanded CRUD funtionity with the previous catoeries Query and List functions.

# Databases

The main artifact selected for the database category is the data from Salver Search for Rescue web app.  The app uses restful API and http protocols to take data from a mongo DB and create a map interface using Lat and Lon coordinates.  My improvement for the artifact was taking the data from the artifact and create a system to analyze the data.  First was creating a way to be able to access the data, with that I uploaded the .cvs file to GitHub.  Then I created a HTML, JS and, CSS web page to import and visualize that data.  Using chat.js I was able to create a graph using specific entities to a color to make the visualization easier.  So, it is easier to see what are dogs and cats, and where their age in weeks falls on the graph.  This showcases skills with data analytics and being able to implements APIâ€™s and valuations the information.  This could easily be scaled up in a way to import vast amounts of data from AWS or Azure and then create visualizations based on hypothetical questions a company or client may have.
