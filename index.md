# This is still a Work in Progress, Class Finsihes at the end of December

# Welcome

This ePortfolio integrates the knowledge and skills I gained and developed throughout the years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It represent my growth in the program and gained honor rolls from high-quality outcomes. The ePortfolio was designed and developed with a professional-quality written and a visual communication demonstrative of my capacities and abilities in a coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to an specific technical audience and context.

# Professional self-assessment

I began my computer science journey starting in April 2019.  I decided on the computer science program because of my passion for working with and technology and software.  While in this program I gained knowledge and skills in many different applications.  I have improved my organization skills, attention to detail and understanding how workflow works when dealing with software development.  With going through this program, I have learned how to implement code reviews, best practices and security standards to all my code.  I also, learned the importance of Software Development Lifecycle and how this is implemented to enterprise scale operations.  By incorporating the SDLC into my coding practices I can correctly use pseudocode, Flow charts and algorithms.

Throughout the program has led to an increased capacity for learning with being able to bring solutions to problems when data, software and technology are involved.  While completing this program I have gained many skills and then throughout the courses my capacity for those sills increased as well.  Learning and implementing how agile and waterfall developments works into my projects as well as using fundamentally computer science foundations to build them.

Skills I learned over the course in relation to the development pipe line was planning and finding what the needs of the project are.  In the screen shot below is the beginning on the planning phase for a database for a pizza company.  These planning phase makes sure all needs are covered and implemented into the planning phase.  This allows a check list to go over as each class is built in the desired database.

## Portfolio Considerations

## Preparing for the Future

My ePortfolio demonstates my skills and abiliters as a software devlopper.  The ePortfolio also, demostarts the ability to adpart and learn with many different projects and classes using a varity of skills and programming languages.  I look forward to leaning, growing and am driven to complete work in a quality focused manner.

    <p><em>Adding LS and CRUD</em></p>
</div>

The artifact selected for the software design and engineering category is the pymongo CRUD aplication from Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  The aplciations goal is to create the functionitily of CRUD for use with the mongodb database.  This showcaseese software design and engineering skills by examding the Python PyMongo drivers with dash framework intigartion.  With the CRUD module exanded with a Query and List funtion, this allows the data to be manipulated in a more streamlined way.

# Algorithms and Data Structure

## Artifact Algorithms and Data Structures

    <p><em>Modifying Script to work with addition to LS in CRUD</em></p>
</div>

The artifact selectedd for the Alogorithim and data structure category is the Pymongo Script created and used in the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  I selected this artifact becacuse its consists of design considerations and creating an API to both use the artifact from software design and enineering and theailbity to quickly call an APU and manipulate and test data.  This showcases data structure skills with creating a script to quickly excute the expanded CRUD funtionity with the previous catoeries Query and List functions.

# Databases

For the databasee artifact I decided to take the data and impliment it into a HTML, CSS, and Javascript set up.  This showcases the skills needed to build and full stack application using a data fill CSV file.  Along with importing the data to use chart.js to visual show the data in a meaningful way.  With this data I built the chart to show the age fo the dogs and cats in weeks.  Along with that showing each catorgoeie in a differnet color to easier disgunish between dogs and cats.
