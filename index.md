# Welcome

This ePortfolio integrates the knowledge and skills I gained and developed throughout the years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It represent my growth in the program and gained honor rolls from high-quality outcomes. The ePortfolio was designed and developed with a professional-quality written and a visual communication demonstrative of my capacities and abilities in a coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to an specific technical audience and context.

# Professional self-assessment

I begain my computer science jouney starting in April, 2019.  I decided on the comptuer sciecne program beucase of my passion fro working with and technology and software.  While in this program I gained knowleged and skills in many different aplications.  I have improved my organization skills, attention to detail and understanding how workflow works when dealing with software devlopment.  With going through this program I have learned how to impliment code reviews, best practices and secruity standards to all my code.  I also, learned the importance of Software Development Lifecycle and how this is implimetned to enterpruise scale operations.  By incorpting the SDLC into my coding practices I am able to correctly use pseudocode, Flow charts and algorithms.

Thoughout the program has led to an increased capiticy for learning with beingable to bring solutions to problems when data, software and technology are involved.

## Portfolio Considerations

## Preparing for the Future

My ePortfolio demonstates my skills and abiliters as a software devlopper.  The ePortfolio also, demostarts the ability to adpart and learn with many different projects and classes using a varity of skills and programming languages.  I look forward to leaning, growing and am driven to complete work in a quality focused manner.

# Refinement Plan and Code Review

# Software Design and Engineering

## Artifact Software Design and Engineering

The artifact selected for the software design and engineering category is the pymongo CRUD aplication from Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  The aplciations goal is to create the functionitily of CRUD for use with the mongodb database.  This showcaseese software design and engineering skills by examding the Python PyMongo drivers with dash framework intigartion.  With the CRUD module exanded with a Query and List funtion, this allows the data to be manipulated in a more streamlined way.

# Algorithms and Data Structure

## Artifact Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact selectedd for the Alogorithim and data structure category is the Pymongo Script created and used in the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  I selected this artifact becacuse its consists of design considerations and creating an API to both use the artifact from software design and enineering and theailbity to quickly call an APU and manipulate and test data.  This showcases data structure skills with creating a script to quickly excute the expanded CRUD funtionity with the previous catoeries Query and List functions.

# Databases

## Artifact Databases
[Database Data](https://codepen.io/daimon2008/pen/yLEvdpb)



For the database category I decided to use the data from the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App project.  I wanted to create a web application within the github enviroment that allowed uses to view and see the data.  This showcases skills in the database skill set, by manpulated the data and showing it in a grah based form.
