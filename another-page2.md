## About James Rivers
the company strap mantra, strap line whatever you want to call it, is 'learning is doing'.... I created that and set about having all staff tutors and delegates alike believe in that moto as much as I do.  

_History_
Originated from Kent, South East England from a city called Canterbury. 

Mid teens became progressivly involved in local radio, from engineering, producing, presenting etc... great years. Not so great at the time having to be on air overnight (graveyard shift ... ) and or waking up at 3am to get in for early breakfast show at 5am. But you look back on those years with extreme fondness. 

From local radio to world wide radio -  in the form of the BBC World Serivce, most of my twenties spent working at Bush House London covering control room aspects, chasing studio managers who hadn't turned up, or establishing links with roving resporters across the globe wanting to send there report. The internet was there but just not quite good enough or adopted. Even for low bit rate radio...

_"The joy of networks"_ that is what I will call the next stage of my life, building and delivering a "Global Media Network" based on MPLS and working with UK telecoms. Networks broadcasting hadn't quite reached the scale we know today (2019) but it was an ey opener that I still work withj today, networking and broadcasting media goes hand in hand and I am incredibly lucky to have been working with networks so early on. 

Years of professional field service and project management roles followed working for a couple of the UKs broadcast vendors. - yes they have both changed their names now - who hasn't...

Since 2013, training and education has been the role I have adaopted. Not an easy role as some may think. You need to know your subject matter. You have to grind to get the knowledge, be proactive and never stop learning. I am the first to say that 'I do not know everything"... I try, but there is way to much to be across and know everything. You need to be confident, yet humble and be prepared to get a few knocks along the way.
